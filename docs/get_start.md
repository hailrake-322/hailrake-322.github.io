# Start working with the board

* Download the latest version of the launcher from the server in [this page](/launcher/).

* It is recommended to create a shared folder for working with the panel, and download everything from the launcher to it for greater convenience

* Install the latest version of the project for Keil, DFP from the launcher, also download the latest SDK and, if desired, the simulator.

* Next, to flash the board with jtag, you need to add the flm files to Keil, for this, see [this guide](/addflm/).

* Install all the packs that come with it from DFP

* Download EEZ Studio (only from [launcher](/launcher/).)
* This is where the minimum requirements for work end, but you can look at the rest of the guides to better understand how to work with the board
